- Vinh made the changes to the GitHub repository to update meetings.md, fixed up the wording and numberings of each requirement to make it clearer, changed some of the requirements and made the necessary changes to the UI images to reflect the changes made. Changes were also made to some of the use cases to remove the first step of the primary sequence so that it was not the same as the trigger.

- Each team member also revised the GitHub repository to make sure they know which requirements they are responsible for. The group also worked together to help each other on how to get the project started and determined a timeline of when to get complete each milestone by in order to successfully complete the project in time.

- We tried resolving all technical difficulties that we were experiencing using Visual Studio code and pushing our changes to our repository. Most problems were resolved by the end of our meeting with some minor challenges still present. The group has been remaining in good contact with each other, and we have set a goal to complete milestone 2 by Sunday night. 

- There will not be another in person meeting until we come back from Thanksgiving; however, we may have an online meeting over the weekend/break.

- Every group member completed all of the requirements they were responsible for. We met up to clean up some of the unnecessary stuff from our code that was included throughout the project and tested the code to make sure everything worked. Small touchups and changes were made to make the UI more appealing. We also did a screen recording of our website that is included in the README.md file to showcase what our website looks like.
