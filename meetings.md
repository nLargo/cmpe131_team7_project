- Vinh made the changes to the GitHub repository to update meetings.md, fixed up the wording and numberings of each requirement to make it clearer, changed some of the requirements and made the necessary changes to the UI images to reflect the changes made. Changes were also made to some of the use cases to remove the first step of the primary sequence so that it was not the same as the trigger.

- Each team member also revised the GitHub repository to make sure they know which requirements they are responsible for. The group also worked together to help each other on how to get the project started and determined a timeline of when to get complete each milestone by in order to successfully complete the project in time.
