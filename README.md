# Ethical Implications Milestone 2:
Some ethical considerations our team made prior to building the notes app was primarily based around security. In a societal context, users will not want others to be able to read their notes without permission because they could have written sensitive/personal material (ie. a diary). On the other hand, our app has no form of collaborations that could otherwise be considered an enriching feature for the implimentation of our app to a global market. The environmental impact that a note-taking app could relieve is the overuse of paper materials. Though using a notes app will not completely resolve any environmental problem, the hope is that there will be enough users that prefer an app over paper and pencils to eliminate deforrestation for the purpose of merely taking a quick note. Finally, a note-taking app should be economically sustainable. As engineers, we have to raise the concern that there may be a plethora of individuals who lack funds for a device with note-taking capabilities. That being said, those who already own a device with said capabilities will not have to pay for writing utensils and paper ever again. In summary, our note-taking app considers many ethical situations, yet it focuses on the issues of security, the environment, and even finances that are at stake with traditional pen and paper note-taking.
